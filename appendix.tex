Getters must coordinate such that one is elected the \textit{mover} with all others cloning. The mover must go last, and once everyone is done, the resource must be cleaned up.}

It unrolls the movement of the entire object into a large sequence of smaller operations rather than invoking a system call. This is the case for the receipt of a \code{Copy}-type represented by 512 bytes.}

Rust's vtables have a predictable structure with three fields followed by trait-defined function pointers. Lines~10--12 store (1) pointer to the concrete type's \code{drop} function, (2) size of the concrete type in bytes, (3) memory-alignment of the concrete type in bytes. }
