Getters must coordinate such that one is elected the \textit{mover} with all others cloning. The mover must go last, and once everyone is done, the resource must be cleaned up.}

It unrolls the movement of the entire object into a large sequence of smaller operations rather than invoking a system call. This is the case for the receipt of a \code{Copy}-type represented by 512 bytes.}
